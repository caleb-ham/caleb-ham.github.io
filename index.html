<h2>Swimming Robot</h2>
<p>Hull building has been main priority so far, also presentation preperation and research(W.I.P)
</p>
<h2>Simple Braitenburg Machine</h2>
<img src="first_it.jpg" alt="First iteration circuit with some items removed" style="float:right;width:150px;height:150px;">
<p>Today has mainly consisted of a workshop creating a very simplistic A.I robot requiring no programming. The concept is to create 
a basic robot that reacts to light and has a noticable behaviour pattern to interact with it such as shy being light avoidance. 
This is achieved by using two Light dependant resistors to control actuators of some kind to create movement By the end of the session
 We had created a working, very barebones circuit that reacted to the light around it and attempted to move about its environment, in
 attempting to have our bot be as small as possible we ran into multiple problems the main one being the motors having very little torque,
  and thus the weight of our machine was integral. It was obvious the breadboard was not going to work and was only a prototype for the 
  circuit required to make it move.

 <p> Our second iteration used a small piece of stripboard cut down as small as the circuit required, while it showed some small progress
 it was still not ideal as only with some help would the motors be able to move. We had to further reduce the weight of the vehicle itself
 or find some way to generate more torque in the wheels. 
 </p>
 <img src="third_it.jpg" alt="third iteration of robot with 3d soldered components." style="float:right;width:150px;height:150px;">
 <p> This lead to our third iteration which was very intersting. Stripping it down to the most basic form possible it was essentially
 soldered in 3D entirely removing the need for the board. Components were soldered directly to one another to form the circuit without
 any other form of conductive medium. We attached the circuit to a small rectangle of cardboard with hot glue, still it had too much weight 
 and would not move independantly.
</p>
<p> This is when harry created our final iteration with a tiny 3D printed chassis with incredibly little infil to reduce the weight massively.
To reduce the drag a paperclip end was used to contact the ground and finally we had a braitenburg robot that would react to light and could
actively move itself without the need for any assistance.

<h2>Advancing The Braitenburg</h2>
<p> After finishing the most basic form of Braitenburg robot with only electrical components and no proccessor it was time to form new pairs
 and build the same robot however this time it would involve the use of a microproccesor in order to form a finite state machine (fsm) more akin to the 
 idea behind a Braitenburg robot that would have various behavioural patterns dependant on its "mood".
