<p>Today has mainly consisted of a workshop creating a very simplistic A.I robot requiring no programming. The concept is to create a basic robot 
that reacts to light and has a noticable behaviour pattern to interact with it such as shy being light avoidance. This is 
achieved by using two Light dependant resistors to control actuators of some kind to create movement</p>
<p>By the end of the session We had created a working, very barebones circuit that reacted to the light around it and attempted to move about its
environment</p>
